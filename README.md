# ML_Classification_Model_Weather_Predictions
In this project, we aim to predict whether it will rain tomorrow in Madrid, Spain, using machine learning. We have a rich dataset covering daily meteorological reports in Madrid from 1997 to 2015. By analyzing the data, our goal is to train a machine learning model that can provide accurate rain forecasts.
The project focuses on leveraging data-driven techniques to improve weather predictions, highlighting the practical application of machine learning in meteorology. Our findings could enhance our understanding of Madrid's local climate and contribute to more reliable weather forecasts for the city.
